# elsa
To start using this code:

 1) create a symbolic link inside the elsa folder that points to the data you wish to analyze. i.e. 'ln -s /Path/To/My/Data data'
 
 2)create a place to store the stage0 data and the stage1 data  'mkdir stage0'  'mkdir stage1'
 
 3) build the library by: './build_library'
 
 And you should be good to go.
